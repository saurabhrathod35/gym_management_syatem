			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The intensity of your yoga
						workout depends on which form of yoga you choose. Techniques like
						hatha and iyengar yoga are gentle and slow. Bikram and power yoga
						are faster and more challenging.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">There are yoga poses to target
						just about every core muscle. Want to tighten those love handles?
						Then prop yourself up on one arm and do a side plank. To really
						burn out the middle of your abs, you can do boat pose, in which
						you balance on your sit bones and hold your legs up in the air.</p>
				</div>

			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div>
					<strong>Arms :</strong>Yes
				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">With yoga, you don't build arm
						strength with free weights or machines, but with the weight of
						your own body. Some poses, like the plank, spread your weight
						equally between your arms and legs. Others, like the crane and
						crow poses, challenge your arms even more by making them support
						your full body weight.</p>
				</div>

			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div>
					<strong>Legs : </strong>Yes
				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoga poses work all sides of
						the legs, including your quadriceps, hips, and thighs.</p>

				<div>
					<strong>Glutes:</strong>Yes
				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoga squats, bridges, and
						warrior poses involve deep knee bends, which give you a more
						sculpted rear.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div>
					<strong>Back : </strong>Yes
				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Moves like downward-facing dog,
						child's pose, and cat/cow give your back muscles a good stretch.
						It's no wonder that research finds yoga is good for relieving a
						sore back.</p>

			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoga poses stretch your muscles
						and increase your range of motion. With regular practice, they'll
						improve your flexibility.</p>

				<div>
					<strong> Aerobic: </strong>No
				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoga isn't considered aerobic
						exercise, but the more athletic varieties, like power yoga, will
						make you sweat. And even though yoga is not aerobic, research
						finds it's just as good as aerobic exercise for improving health.

				</div>
			</div>
			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
					<p style="text-align: justify;">It takes a lot of strength to
						hold your body in a balanced pose. Regular practice will
						strengthen the muscles of your arms, back, legs, and core.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="w3-row">

			<br />
			<div class="w3-row">
				<div class="w3-col m11">
